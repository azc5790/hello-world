    "Since the goal of this project revolves around tracking the purchases of customers in Walt Disney parks, all of the attraction entities are going to be related to the customer purchases. The Some attributes we’d like to keep track of for the customer are their first and last name, age and gender, and purchases (to understand what types of customers are purchasing what types of things). Each customer gets a wristband with a unique ID to identify that customer and keep track of what they are doing throughout their time in the park. With the wristband, you can buy fast passes for rides, which have their own ID numbers; the fast pass will connect the customer’s wristband ID to the ride for which they bought the fast pass. This can help understand which rides are most popular, since more fast passes are likely to be bought to skip the longer line. For rides, we can keep track of the type of ride (roller coaster, spinning, etc.) and the average wait time and compare that to the average number of customers who ride in a day (and what demographic of customers) to understand what rides will be most beneficial to a new park. Customers can use their wristbands to purchase merchandise. By using the wristband to purchase the merchandise, it allows the park to understand what type of merchandise the customer bought, the price of the merchandise, and where it was purchased. This can show which merchandise is a top seller and which are not selling as much. Also, if a specific merchandise is low on supply it should remind the park to restock on that type of merchandise. For shows, the park can see what shows appeal to what type of age groups (infants, teens, etc.). Additionally, the park can see how many people attend a specific show at a specific time to see which show time attracts the most customers. Customers can also use their wristbands to go to restaurants. This shows which restaurant might be the most popular and how much the average diner would spend at a specific restaurant. It can also show which type of cuisine attracts more customers and how much money a restaurant made in a day. An attribute common across all entities within the park is the location of the restaurant, shop, ride, etc. To help park designers, we can keep track of park attractions locations in relation to each other to understand how the geography of the park may or may not affect customer purchases."
